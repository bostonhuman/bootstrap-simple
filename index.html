If you're going to be thinking anything then you might as well think massive."</p>

					<h3><a href="#">Not viewing failure as failure</a></h3>
					<p>Billionares and other wealthy people do not view failure as failure and that it's game over. Alternatively, they simply see it as a stumbling block to success and one that provides opportunities to learn from. All billionaires failed numerous times in their quest to accumulate their wealth but they viewed it ass a learning opportunity to help them achieve their dreams and their goals. Henry Ford sums it up best, "Failure is just a resting place. It is an opportunity to begin again more intelligently."</p>

					<h3><a href="#">They take responsibility for their results</a></h3>
					<p>No matter whether it's failure or success billionares take responsibility for their results. Even when they experience failures and setbacks they do and they don't do it because they like it. They do it because psychologically, it acknowledges to the mind that they also have the power to turn a negative result around.</p>

					<h3><a href="#">They don't believe in playing it safe</a></h3>
					<p>Billionaires play the money game to win. Do you? This certainly doesn't mean they are reckless with their money but they aren't approaching opportunities with a mindset of not losing what they have or being comfortable with what they have but rather trying to find ways to become rich.</p>
